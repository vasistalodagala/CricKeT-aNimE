An all in all cricket game on Turbo C++ that is similar to a mobile version.

This is a game of Cricket inspired from the Cricket game on Nokia mobile. Built on Borland Turbo C++ using graphics.h library.
The CRICKET.exe file doesn't run on 64-bit machines.
It is therefore advised that the user runs the executable file on a 32-bit machine. The code was built and tested on Windows XP 32-bit.

Installing Turbo C:
The zip file provided would be useful.
Installation instructions can be found at https://www.cyberfreewishes.com/blog/turbo-c-c-free-download-and-installation-process#.W_jSZRBoRND

Including the MOUSE.H file:
The MOUSE.h file doesn’t come along with the header files that are a part of turbo c.
So, after the installation of turbo c, it is recommended of the user to copy this mouse.h file into the include folder in the tc folder (generally found in c drive if you’ve given the installation path as c drive ).

Compilation: 
To re-compile and execute the source code, open turbo c, create a project by clicking on the project option in the taskbar, include both the .cpp files as a part of the project and save it in .prj form. Then compile and run.

Thank you.
